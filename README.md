Flood Risk & Social Vulnerability in California

This project examines how social vulnerability overlaps with FEMA-designated flood risk zones in two California counties: Alameda County and Riverside County.

The goal is not just to map where floods may occur, but to understand who may struggle most to recover when they do.

Motivation

Where I’m from (Karachi), flooding consistently affects lower-income neighborhoods the hardest. I wanted to explore how social vulnerability interacts with flood risk in California and whether similar patterns emerge.

Flooding is a physical hazard, but recovery depends heavily on financial capacity. Households with limited income or high rent burdens may face greater difficulty evacuating, accessing insurance, or paying for temporary housing and repairs.

Research Question

Are communities facing poverty or severe rent burden more likely to be located inside FEMA Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs)?

What does this imply for evacuation planning, insurance access, and disaster recovery policy?

Data Sources

American Community Survey (ACS)

Alameda County: Poverty rate (≤ 200% of Federal Poverty Level) – Table C17002

Riverside County: Severe rent burden (≥ 50% of income on rent) – Table B25070

FEMA Flood Zones

Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA)

All analysis is conducted at the census tract level.

Methodology

Mapped FEMA SFHAs for both counties.

Calculated tract-level social vulnerability indicators:

Poverty (Alameda)

Severe rent burden (Riverside)

Compared average vulnerability rates inside vs. outside flood zones.

Visualized spatial overlap using GIS tools.

Key Findings
Alameda County – Poverty

Outside SFHA: 25% below 200% FPL

Inside SFHA: 18% below 200% FPL

Higher poverty rates are not concentrated inside FEMA flood zones. This suggests that vulnerability in Alameda may be shaped more by housing costs and displacement pressures than direct floodplain exposure.

Riverside County – Severe Rent Burden

Outside SFHA: 26.2%

Inside SFHA: 28.1%

Renters inside flood zones show a modestly higher severe rent burden. This indicates reduced financial slack for evacuation, repairs, and temporary relocation after a flood event.

Interpretation

Flood maps show where water may go.

Social vulnerability indicators show who may struggle most when it gets there.

The results suggest that exposure and vulnerability do not always perfectly overlap. Disaster planning should consider both physical risk and economic resilience.

Policy Implications

Target preparedness outreach in tracts with high rent burden inside SFHAs.

Prioritize shelter siting in financially vulnerable areas.

Consider affordability constraints in flood insurance outreach.

Use tract-level mapping to inform local resilience planning.

Limitations

ACS tract-level estimates contain margins of error.

FEMA SFHA maps reflect regulatory risk and may not capture future climate-related exposure.

This is a cross-sectional analysis and does not model flood events over time.

Conclusion

Income and rent burden help identify who is least able to cope with a flood, not just where flooding may occur.

Understanding both hazard exposure and economic vulnerability is essential for equitable disaster planning.
